  <!-- AFC EAST HISTORY -->
  <section id="history">
    <h2>History of the AFC East</h2>
    <p>
      The American Football Conference – Eastern Division, commonly known as the AFC East, is one of the four divisions in the American Football Conference (AFC) of the National Football League (NFL). This division includes four teams: the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, and New York Jets. All these teams were originally part of the Eastern Division of the American Football League (AFL).
  </p>
  <p> The AFC East is notable for having both perfect regular seasons in professional football since the adoption of a 14-game schedule: the 1972 Dolphins, who completed a perfect 17–0 season, and the 2007 Patriots, who finished 18–1 after losing Super Bowl XLII. Since its establishment in 1960 with the creation of the AFL, the division has been represented in 22 Super Bowls, winning 11 of them. The most recent Super Bowl appearance by an AFC East team was the Patriots' victory in Super Bowl LIII. Collectively, the current teams have won nine Super Bowl titles: six by the Patriots, two by the Dolphins, and one by the Jets.

  </p><p> The current champions of the AFC East are the Bills, who have won five consecutive division titles from 2020 through 2024. Previously, the Patriots had an eleven-year streak from 2009 through 2019. The Patriots hold the record for the most AFL/AFC East titles with 22, followed by the Bills with 15, and the Dolphins with 14. The Jets have won four titles. Two former members of the division, the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans) and the Baltimore–Indianapolis Colts, combined for ten AFL/AFC East titles.

  </p><p>AFC East teams have won a total of 26 AFL or AFC championships: 11 by the Patriots, 6 by the Bills, 5 by the Dolphins, 2 by the now-Titans, and 1 each by the Jets and Colts.

  </p><p>The American Football League Eastern Division was formed in 1960 as a counterpart to the AFL Western Division. The original alignment included the Buffalo Bills, Boston Patriots, New York Titans, and Houston Oilers. The Miami Dolphins joined the division in 1966. The division remained mostly intact after the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, with the exception of the Houston Oilers moving to the AFC Central and being replaced by the Baltimore Colts. The Colts continued to play in the AFC East until the NFL's 2002 re-alignment.

  </p><p>Despite Miami being further south than the other teams, all four AFC East teams have strong historical rivalries dating back to their AFL days. All teams are based in the Eastern Time Zone.

  </p><p>None of the AFC East teams currently play within the central city of their metropolitan area:

    <ul>
        <li>The Bills play in Orchard Park, New York.</li>
        <li>The Jets play in East Rutherford, New Jersey, sharing a stadium with the New York Giants.</li>
        <li>The Dolphins play in Miami Gardens, Florida.</li>
        <li>The Patriots play in Foxborough, Massachusetts.</li>
      </ul>

<p>Interestingly, three out of the four NFC East teams also do not play within the city of their naming, with the Philadelphia Eagles being the exception.

</p> <p>All AFC East teams have been coached by members of the Bill Parcells coaching tree at some point. Notable coaches include Bill Belichick for the Patriots, Tony Sparano for the Dolphins, Eric Mangini for the Jets, and Dick Jauron for the Bills. Parcells himself coached the Patriots and Jets and was Vice President of Football Operations for the Dolphins.

</p> <p>ESPN's Chris Berman often refers to this division as the "AFC Adams" due to its geographical similarity to the old Adams Division of the NHL.

</p><p>Along with the AFC West, the AFC East is the oldest NFL division, established in 1960.
