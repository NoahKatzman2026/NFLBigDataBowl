    <section id="overview">
      <h2 class="dolphins-h2">Team Overview</h2>
      <p>The Miami Dolphins are a professional American football team based in the Miami metropolitan area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as part of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, a northern suburb of Miami. Owned by Stephen M. Ross, the Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Among the four AFC East teams, they are the only one that was not a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the southeast, along with the Atlanta Falcons.</p>

      <p> Founded by attorney and politician Joe Robbie and actor and comedian Danny Thomas, the Dolphins began playing in the AFL in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the Miami Seahawks, who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946 before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts. Initially, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew's School, a private boys' boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as part of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger.</p>
        
      <p>The Dolphins played in their first Super Bowl in Super Bowl VI, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, 24–3. The following year, they completed the NFL's only perfect season, culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular season games and all three of their playoff games, including Super Bowl VII. They were the third NFL team to achieve a perfect regular season and remain the only team to do so, including playoffs, since the AFL-NFL merger. The next year, the Dolphins won Super Bowl VIII, becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX, losing both games.</p>
        
      <p>For most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula, the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins had losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as head coach. From 1983 to 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring after the 1999 season.</p>
        
      <p> Since Marino's retirement, the Dolphins have experienced mediocre success, with just six playoff appearances (2000, 2001, 2008, 2016, 2022, and 2023) and two division titles (2000 and 2008) with one playoff win. They currently have the longest postseason win drought in the NFL.</p>
