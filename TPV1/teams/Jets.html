      <h2 class="jets-h2">Team Overview</h2>
      <p>The New York Jets are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as part of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which they share with the New York Giants. The Jets are headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey.</p>

      <p> The franchise was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York, a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The team began play in 1960 at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan. In 1963, under new ownership, the team was renamed the New York Jets and moved to Shea Stadium in Queens in 1964. The Jets joined the NFL in 1970 following the AFL–NFL merger and moved to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey in 1984.</p>
        
      <p> The Jets advanced to the AFL playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III, where they defeated the Baltimore Colts, becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game. This victory remains the Jets' only Super Bowl appearance and win.</p>
        
      <p>Throughout their history, the Jets have had periods of success and struggle. They have won four division championships (1968, 1969, 1998, and 2002) and have made 14 playoff appearances. The team is known for its passionate fan base and the "Gang Green" defense, particularly the "New York Sack Exchange" defensive line of the early 1980s.</p>

      <p> The franchise is currently owned by Woody Johnson and Christopher Johnson. The Jets have had several notable players and coaches, including Joe Namath, who famously guaranteed and delivered the Super Bowl III victory, and more recently, head coach Aaron Glenn, who is leading the team into a new era.</p>
