      <h2 class="patriots-h2">Team Overview</h2>
      <p>The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as part of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is located 22 miles southwest of downtown Boston.</p>

      <p> Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 following the AFL–NFL merger. The team changed its name to the New England Patriots in 1971 to reflect its new home in Foxborough. The Patriots are owned by Robert Kraft, who purchased the team in 1994.</p>
        
      <p> The Patriots have a storied history, particularly in the 21st century. Under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, the team won six Super Bowl titles (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII), the most in NFL history for a head coach-quarterback duo. The Patriots have appeared in 11 Super Bowls, the most of any team, and have won 22 division titles, including 17 in the 21st century.</p>
        
      <p>The team has also set numerous records, including the longest winning streak in NFL history (21 games from 2003 to 2004) and the only undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007. The Patriots' success has made them one of the most popular and valuable franchises in the NFL.

      <p> Since Tom Brady's departure in 2020, the Patriots have been in a period of transition, with mixed results. They have made the playoffs twice (2020 and 2021) but have not advanced past the Wild Card round.</p>
